# Advance ml - Telecom churn Case Study
> In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.


## Business Objective
To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. The given dataset contains customer-level informations for few consecutive months June, July & August they are encoded as 6,7 & 8. The business objective is to predict the cusotmer which will churn in next month by analyzing the dataset 


## High Value Customers:
One of the primary goal is to identify high value customers which are more likely to churn, as most of the profit comes from high value customers.

Customers which are likely to churn will starting decreasing rhe recharge amount and other facilities. To identify high value customers, total_rech_data can be calculated and total dataser can be filtered which are greater than 70th percentil of the data
